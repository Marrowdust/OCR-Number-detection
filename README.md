# OCR-Number-detection
This project is an implementation of a Gradio Web ui 
that hosts the roboflow House number dataset [ SVHN ]
and vgg pretrained model
but generally works for any type of any general number detections
uses bounding box regresssors and outputs the numbers in the web based on the input you insert
